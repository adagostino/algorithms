algorithms
==========

Here is a small repository of javascript implementations of useful algorithms. The purpose of the repository is to refresh my memory and practice writing efficient and elegeant code during interviews. Since these algorithms can sometimes be discussed using a lot of hand-waving, hopefully seeing the actual code will help someone other than me.

Below is an updated list of algorithms and some minor notes on them.

Quicksort (added 7/22/13):

Skiena, SS. 2010. The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Ed, p.124. Springer-Verlag, London, United Kingdom

A simple implementation of quicksort using prototypal inheritance. As can be seen by the tests performed in quicksort.html, it's probably best to just use the native javascript sorting algorithms as they outperform this particular implementation.
